# Rename Folders → Decks & Add Save History

## Context

DeckDiffer currently calls its top-level concept a "folder" — but it's really a deck. The app also has zero persistence; everything lives in React `useState` and is lost on refresh. This change renames "folder" to "deck" everywhere, adds localStorage persistence so decks survive refresh, and introduces a save-history system where each save is a snapshot of the decklist that can be loaded or diffed against any other save.

---

## Data Model

### New types — `src/lib/deck.ts` (replaces `src/lib/folders.ts`)

```typescript
type DeckSave = {
  id: string              // crypto.randomUUID()
  savedAt: string         // ISO-8601
  label: string           // "Save #N" or user-provided
  cards: ValidatedDeckCard[]
}

type DeckItem = {
  id: string
  name: string
  createdAt: string       // ISO-8601
  updatedAt: string       // ISO-8601
  saves: DeckSave[]       // oldest-first
}
```

Helpers: `createDeck(name)`, `createDeckSave(cards, label?, saveCount?)`, `getLatestSave(deck)`.

Each save stores the full `ValidatedDeckCard[]` — self-contained, trivially diffable. Saves live as an array on `DeckItem` itself (one storage key per deck list, simple).

### Persistence — `src/lib/storage.ts` (new)

localStorage under key `deckdiffer:decks`. Synchronous read/write.

Functions: `loadDecks()`, `saveDecks(decks)`, `loadDeckById(id)`, `upsertDeck(deck)`, `deleteDeck(id)`.

- `src/lib/folders.ts` — fully replaced by `deck.ts`

### Modified (import updates + minor logic)

| File | What changes |
|------|-------------|
| `src/routes/index.tsx` | Import from `deck.ts`/`storage.ts`; rename folder→deck in variables, UI text, and links (`/decks/$deckId`) |
| `src/routes/decks.$deckId.tsx` | Load deck from storage on mount; hydrate editor from latest save; add save handler; add Editor/History tab switcher |
| `src/components/decks/DeckCard.tsx` | Accept `DeckItem`; show `saves.length` count; link to `/decks/$deckId`; swap Folder icon |
| `src/components/decks/CreateDeckModal.tsx` | Rename labels (folder→deck) |
| `src/components/deck-editor/EditorHeader.tsx` | Add `onSave` prop + Save button (cyan primary style) |
| `src/components/deck-editor/EditorDeckList.tsx` | Add optional `readOnly` prop to hide QuantityStepper and restore buttons |

### Unchanged

`editorRows.ts`, `types.ts`, `DeckAlerts.tsx`, `ImportDeckModal.tsx`, `ExportDeckModal.tsx`, `QuantityStepper.tsx`, `ToggleChip.tsx`, `scryfall.ts`, `decklist.ts`, `__root.tsx`, `router.tsx`

---

## UI Design

### Home page (`/`)

- Grid of `DeckCard` components + "New Deck" button
- Each card: deck name, save count (e.g. "3 saves"), icon swap from `Folder` to `Layers` or `FileStack`
- Decks loaded from `loadDecks()` on mount
- Creating a new deck calls `createDeck(name)` + `upsertDeck()`

### Deck page (`/decks/$deckId`) — Tab switcher

A tab bar at the top of the deck section with two tabs: **Editor** and **History**.

**Editor tab** (default): The existing deck editor, unchanged except:
- On mount, if the deck has saves, hydrate `baselineDeck` and `workingCards` from the latest save
- Save button in `EditorHeader` — creates a `DeckSave` snapshot of current `workingCards`, appends to `deck.saves`, persists via `upsertDeck()`, resets baseline to the saved state

**History tab**: `SaveHistoryPanel` showing:
- Chronological list of saves (newest first) with label, timestamp
- "Load" button on each save — loads that save's cards into the editor and switches to Editor tab
- Compare mode: select two saves → renders a read-only diff using `buildEditorRows(saveA.cards, saveB.cards)` → displayed in `EditorDeckList` with `readOnly` prop (hides quantity steppers and restore buttons, same color-coded category-grouped layout)

### Save flow

1. User clicks Save in EditorHeader
2. `SaveDeckModal` opens with optional label input (defaults to "Save #N")
3. On confirm: `createDeckSave(workingCards, label, deck.saves.length)` → append to deck → `upsertDeck()` → baseline resets

### Diffing between saves

Reuses `buildEditorRows(olderSave.cards, newerSave.cards)` + `groupEditorRows()` — zero changes to diff logic. The resulting `EditorRow[]` with `status: same|added|removed|changed` renders in `EditorDeckList` with `readOnly={true}`.

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1 — Data model + storage (no UI)
1. Create `src/lib/deck.ts` with types and helpers
2. Create `src/lib/storage.ts` with localStorage functions
3. Verify both compile

### Phase 2 — Rename folder → deck (routing + home page)
4. Rename route file `folders.$folderId.tsx` → `decks.$deckId.tsx`; update `createFileRoute` path and param name
5. Rename `src/components/folders/` → `src/components/decks/`; rename components + props
6. Update `src/routes/index.tsx` to use new imports, deck terminology, and `loadDecks()`/`upsertDeck()`
7. Delete `src/lib/folders.ts`
8. Run dev server to regenerate `routeTree.gen.ts`; verify app works

### Phase 3 — Persistence (save/load)
9. In `decks.$deckId.tsx`: load deck from storage, hydrate from latest save
10. Add `handleSave` function
11. Add Save button to `EditorHeader` (`onSave` + `saveDisabled` props)
12. Create `SaveDeckModal`
13. Test: create deck → import → edit → save → refresh → verify persistence

### Phase 4 — Save history + diffing
14. Add Editor/History tab switcher to deck page
15. Create `SaveHistoryPanel` with saves list + Load button
16. Add `readOnly` prop to `EditorDeckList`
17. Add compare mode: select two saves → render read-only diff
18. Test: save multiple times → switch to History → load old save → compare two saves

---

## Verification

1. **Persistence**: Create a deck, import a list, save, refresh the browser — deck and save should survive
2. **Multiple saves**: Save, edit, save again — two entries in history with different card lists
3. **Load old save**: From History tab, load an earlier save — editor hydrates with those cards
4. **Diff two saves**: Select two saves in compare mode — read-only diff shows adds/removes/changes with correct color coding
5. **Route change**: Navigating to `/decks/some-id` works; old `/folders/` routes 404
6. **New deck**: Home page "New Deck" creates and persists a deck; navigating to it shows empty editor
7. **No regressions**: Import, search-add, quantity adjust, export, and restore still work exactly as before

| Phase 2 — Rename folder → deck | ✅ Complete | Routing + home page + deck actions |
| Phase 3 — Persistence (save/load) | ✅ Complete | Save button + modal + hydration |

---

### Phase 4 Details

**Goal**: Add History tab to view and compare deck saves. Allow loading old saves and diffing between saves.

**Files to modify**:
- ✅ `src/routes/decks.$deckId.tsx`: Add Editor/History tab switcher, load handler, compare mode state
- ✅ `src/components/deck-editor/EditorDeckList.tsx`: Add `readOnly` prop to hide quantity steppers/restore buttons

**Files to create**:
- ✅ `src/components/deck-editor/SaveHistoryPanel.tsx` — List of saves with load/compare UI

**QA Checklist for Phase 4**:
- [x] Tab switcher shows "Editor" and "History" tabs
- [x] History tab lists all saves (newest first) with timestamps
- [x] Clicking "Load" on a save switches to Editor tab with that save's cards
- [x] Compare mode: select two saves, shows read-only diff
- [x] Diff shows color-coded adds/removes/changes
- [x] No regressions in editor functionality
